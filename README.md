Use

This more than likely will only run on Chrome at the moment. Sorry :(.

Make sure this is run from a web server. Otherwise Chrome will complain with
a cross origin request error when trying to load local coffeescript files.

This run from within the project directory should do the trick:
`python -m SimpleHTTPServer`

You can then visit: `http://localhost:8000/index.html`


Running Tests
-------------

Tests can be run by visiting: `http://localhost:8000/test.html`
